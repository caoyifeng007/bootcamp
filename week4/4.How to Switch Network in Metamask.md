Metamask isn’t a wallet, it’s a tool that allows you to manage your wallets and use them to interact with dapps. This means that every wallet you unlock in Metamask, can be used across various dapps in the wider dapp ecosystem, including on DappRadar. To use your Portfolio on DappRadar you need to connect your Web3 wallet, for example through Metamask.

See your tokens, NFTs and DeFi positions across different blockchains, all in one place. Connect your Web3 wallet and [check out your portfolio](https://dappradar.com/hub/wallet)!

On desktop Metamask exists as a browser extension, while there’s also a mobile version available. For the purpose of this guide, we look mainly at the desktop version.

## Selecting a Network in Metamask

This guide assumes you already have Metamask installed. If you don’t, install Metamask through [the official website](https://metamask.io/). It will standard be set to the Ethereum blockchain (see image below). Despite current high gas fees, the Ethereum blockchain still is home to many innovations and dapp developments.

If you want to change the network of your Metamask, for example to the Kovan test network, you need to click the ‘down arrow’ next to the current network. It will open a menu where you can select a different network.

## Adding more networks

At the bottom of the aforementioned list with networks, you will see the button “Add Network”. This will allow you to do exactly what it says, add support for another network to your installation of Metamask. However, Metamask only supports networks that are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. Bitcoin is not an option. Thankfully the list of EVM compatible networks is increasing, and you will see that DappRadar supports plenty of those.

1. Click “Add Network”
2. A form will pop-up, requesting some information from you
   1. **Network Name** – you can choose any name, but be wise and just give it the name of the network you’re about to add.
   2. **New RPC URL** – an URL that serves as your entry point to the blockchain
   3. **Chain ID** – an ID number unique to the blockchain network you’re about to interact with
   4. Currency Symbol (optional) – the ticker (i.e. ETH, BNB or MATIC) of the leading currency on the new network
   5. **Block Explorer URL** (optional) – the URL to a block explorer, ideal for users who always want more in-depth information on their transactions.
3. After filling in all the details, click “Save”. You will now find the newly added network in your network selection.
