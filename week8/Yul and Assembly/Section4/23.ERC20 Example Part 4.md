```solidity
            // "balanceOf(address)"
            case 0x70a08231 {
                returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))  // line1
            }
            
            function balanceOf(account) -> bal {
                bal := sload(accountToStorageOffset(account))
            }
```

Now that we know what decodeAsAddress is doing, we can see what balanceOf is doing, so balanceOf is going to load the accountToStorageOffset for the address. 

```solidity
            contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata {
                mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
                
                function balanceOf(address account) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
        						return _balances[account];
    						}
            }
```

Now if we look at a regular solidity implementation of balance of, it's just going to access this mapping over here, which is a mapping from the address to how many coins that person owns.

```solidity
            function ownerPos() -> p { p := 0 }
            function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }
            
            function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
                offset := add(0x1000, account)
            }
```

In this situation, it's going to call this function, and what that does is it just takes an address and adds hex 1000 to it. Remember, under the hood when we have a regular hash map, this (指某一个mapping的key所对应的值) is going to be stored in the keccak256 of the concatenation of this address and the slot of this storage variable over here. However, because we don't have to respect solidity conventions when we're using yul, we can cheat. 

And an account is already the hash of someone's public key, so it's going to be random and not collide, when we add this offset to it (offset指0x1000，并不是指offset这个变量), that means it's not going to crash into any of the storage variables above, so that's kind of handy, so ~~accountToStorageOffset~~ balanceOf will simply load that area in storage and return the balance, and after it's loaded, it's going to return (line1) that to the caller, as we described earlier.
