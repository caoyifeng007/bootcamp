```solidity
// "balanceOf(address)"
case 0x70a08231 {
	returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))  // line1
}

function balanceOf(account) -> bal {
	bal := sload(accountToStorageOffset(account))
}
```

Now that we know what **decodeAsAddress** is doing, we can see what **balanceOf** is doing, so **balanceOf** is going to load the **accountToStorageOffset** for the address (他说的address就是指参数account).

```solidity
contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata {
    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;   // line1

    function balanceOf(address account) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    	return _balances[account];
    }
}
```

Now if we look at a regular Solidity implementation of **balanceOf**, it's just going to access this mapping over here (line1), which is a mapping from the address to how many coins that person owns.

```solidity
// Solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;   // line2

// yul

// "balanceOf(address)"
case 0x70a08231 {
	returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))  // line1
}

function balanceOf(account) -> bal {
	bal := sload(accountToStorageOffset(account))
}

function ownerPos() -> p { p := 0 }
function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }

function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
	offset := add(0x1000, account)
}
```

In this situation, it's going to call this function (指在**balanceOf**中调用**accountToStorageOffset**), and what that does is it just takes an address and adds hex 1000 to it, remember, under the hood when we have a regular hash map, this (以line2为例，指一个mapping的value值) is going to be stored in the **keccak256** of the concatenation of this address and the slot of this storage variable over here. However, because we don't have to respect Solidity conventions when we're using yul, we can cheat. (这段是说Solidity代码要遵守这个规范，但是我们现在是yul，所以一个mapping的value值就简单的加个0x1000就完事了，因为本身address就是哈希函数生成的，两个不同私钥生成的address没有碰撞的可能性，所以可以拿来当slot)

And an account is already the hash of someone's public key, so it's going to be random and not collide, when we add this offset to it (offset指0x1000，并不是指offset这个变量), that means it's not going to crash into any of the storage variables above, so that's kind of handy, so **accountToStorageOffset** will simply load that area in storage (获取account所在的slot) and return the balance (**balanceOf**函数中sload这个slot就获取了这个account对应的balance), and after it's loaded, it's going to return (line1) that to the caller, as we described earlier.
