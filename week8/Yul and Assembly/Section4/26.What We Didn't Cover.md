A natural question at this time, now that we are at the end of the course, is did we cover everything inside of the specification? We did for the most part, but there are some parts of yul that are so obscure and rarely used that I didn't think it was worth creating a separate video for, but let's look over them anyway.

Well, we didn't cover as inside of this table over here, so let me just explain it. If you are doing signed arithmetic, so you are working with signed integers as opposed to unsigned ones or binary numbers that are encoded in two's complement form, you would be using **SDIV** (sign division), **SMOD** (signed modulus), **SLT** (signed less than), **SGT** (sign greater than) and **SAR** (signed shift right), as opposed to the unsigned version of those opcodes. (有符号数的操作符)

Obviously, when you are taking the division of numbers that might not have the same sign, then you need to account for that, and when you are shifting numbers, you don't want to move the bit that is associated with the positive or negative off of the word that you're working with, so these codes will handle it for you

**SIGNEXTEN**, If you're not already familiar with that, don't worry, if you are, it's exactly the same here as is in whatever context you encountered it in, that's basically to give you more bytes to work with if you need a larger sign to number.

**ADDMOD** and **MULMOD**, so if you're familiar with RSA encryption or any modular arithmetic, this is what you would use them for, typically you would be adding or multiplying two numbers modulo or prime, and this will do it in one step as opposed to doing it step by step like I've shown here.

**BYTE** can be handy sometimes, so because you'll always works or rather the EVM always works in 32 byte values, **BYTE** will allow you to extract a particular 8-bit value from that 32 bytes and spare you some masking and shifting like we had talked about earlier. 

**STOP** is just a shortcut for **return(0, 0)**, maybe we should have used that, it's a little cleaner, but that's what it is. 

A **PC** is the program counter, so if you're familiar with compilers that's exactly what it sounds like, this is read-only for safety reasons, you can look up more about program counters online, that is at the point of this course, if this is something you are not already familiar with.

**INVALID** is something that prevents execution of byte codes, now, naturally, well, why don't you just use **STOP** or **return** or something? Sometimes the solidity compiler is going to insert metadata into the byte code just to give you some information about the contract that it compiled, so to prevent that metadata from accidentally getting executed, it will be presented with the invalid keyword, so if you wanted to do something similar like that in yul, then that's what you would use **INVALID** for.
