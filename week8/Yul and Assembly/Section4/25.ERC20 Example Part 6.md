```solidity
function _approve(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual {
    require(owner != address(0), "ERC20: approve from the zero address");
    require(spender != address(0), "ERC20: approve to the zero address");

    _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;  // line1
    emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
}
```

Before we understand the **transferFrom** function, we need to understand **approval** first, let's look at the OpenZeppelin implementation, over here you can see that it is simply a mapping from the **owner** to the **spender** (line1), and the allowance (amount) that the spender has, this functionality is usually used by smart contracts to be able to withdraw tokens from your account.

For example, when you conduct a trade on Uniswap or when you bid for an NFT on Opensea and the seller accepts your bid, that enables the Opensea smart contract to withdraw the tokens from your wallet. (这里列举了一个应用场景，你调用approval批准Uniswap可以从你的账号拿走20个token，然后Uniswap就能调用transferFrom把这20个token转走)

As we reviewed earlier, a double mapping in Solidity is the hash of the concatenation of the storage slot and the keys in the map, but yul doesn't have to follow this mechanism exactly, you can design your hash maps in whatever way make sense in your application. (意思是yul代码不需要遵守Solidiy的规范，只要能实现这个功能就行)

```solidity
//* "approve(address,uint256)" */
case 0x095ea7b3 {
    approve(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
    returnTrue()
}

function approve(spender, amount) {
    revertIfZeroAddress(spender)
    setAllowance(caller(), spender, amount)
    emitApproval(caller(), spender, amount)
}

function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
	offset := add(0x1000, account)
}

function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
    offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)   // line1
    mstore(0, offset)							// line2
    mstore(0x20, spender)						// line3
    offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)				// line4
}
```

In this example, what they are doing is they are taking the storage slot of the account balance (line1，意思是存account balance的slot), storing that in the first slot in the first word in memory (line2), then storing the spender in the second slot in memory (line3), and then hashing those two together, 0x40 is the same as 64 bytes which would be the sum of both of these memory words. (这里**keccak256**是yul的函数)

Note that the storage slot is not included inside of this hash (意思是说line4，keccak256的参数没传入mapping的slot), that is not necessary because there is no other place in this contract where two addresses are being hashed together to get a storage slot, if that was the case, we might have a storage collision, that is why Solidity concatenate the storage slot when it is doing double mappings, but because we know this is the only situation in this smart contract where addresses are combined in this way we don't have to worry about a hash collision. (意思是说在做**嵌套**mapping的时候，每一层哈希都要加上当前mapping所在的slot，这样生成的哈希就能防止碰撞，但是这里不需要，因为整个合约只有这里会用到两个地址放到一起做哈希，如果别的地方也用到了两个地址做哈希那么则需要把当前mapping的slot包括进去一起做哈希)

```solidity
function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
	offset := add(0x1000, account)
}

function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
    offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)   // line1
    mstore(0, offset)							// line2
    mstore(0x20, spender)						// line3
    offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)				// line4
}
```

I do think it's a bit of an interesting design choice that they decided to concatenate the address added with hex 1000 to the **spender** (这个地方account加了0x1000，存到memory的第一个slot里了，spender没加0x1000直接存到memory的第二个slot里), if I were designing this, I would have just put the address of the owner (指account) and the address of the **spender** over here to avoid this extra step, but it works. (指避免额外的**accountToStorageOffset**执行的这一步)

```solidity
// "approve(address,uint256)"
case 0x095ea7b3 {
    approve(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
    returnTrue()
}

function approve(spender, amount) {
    revertIfZeroAddress(spender)				// line1
    setAllowance(caller(), spender, amount)		// line2
    emitApproval(caller(), spender, amount)
}
```

To update this (意思是说更新**allowanceStorageOffset**所存的slot上的值，既allowance值) is straightforward enough, it's done via the **approve** function, which follows the same sequence we were familiar with at this point, zero addresses are not valid (line1), and then it's (line2) going to set the allowance (指**amount**) for the **spender** associated with the person who's calling the function for the given allowance. 

```solidity
function setAllowance(account, spender, amount) {
	sstore(allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender), amount)
}
```

All that (指**setAllowance**函数) does is get the storage offset which is the hash (两个address合一起做**keccak256**) we described earlier and store the allowance there. 

```solidity
// "transferFrom(address,address,uint256)"
case 0x23b872dd {
    transferFrom(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsAddress(1), decodeAsUint(2))
    returnTrue()
}

function transferFrom(from, to, amount) {
    decreaseAllowanceBy(from, caller(), amount)
    executeTransfer(from, to, amount)
}
```

Therefore, when transferFrom (指selector为0x23b872dd的函数) is called, it's going to call the actual implementation (**transferFrom**) of it and do the **executeTransfer** as we described earlier. 

```solidity
function decreaseAllowanceBy(account, spender, amount) {
    let offset := allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender)
    let currentAllowance := sload(offset)
    require(lte(amount, currentAllowance))
    sstore(offset, sub(currentAllowance, amount))
}
```

But first, it's going to decrease the allowance of the spender, it should be pretty obvious what's going on by this point, we're going to get that allowance storage slot, which was computed in the way we described earlier, load the allowance, make sure that they are spending less than what their allowances or less than or equal to, and then store the reduced balance inside of that storage location, again, we do not have to worry about underflow. 

```solidity
function lte(a, b) -> r {
	r := iszero(gt(a, b))
}
function gte(a, b) -> r {
	r := iszero(lt(a, b))
}
```

Now remember, **lte** is not actually a opcode inside of a yul, they created a custom implementation here, which is simply **iszero(gt())**, and this is what Solidity does under the hood when you use a **<=** operator, because there is no opcode that maps directly to this.

So this wraps up the ERC20 yul code review, as a side comment, I'd like to note that this contract is actually quite easy to understand because it uses a lot of small functions that are very well named. The yul optimizer and the recent upgrades in the Solidity compiler are pretty smart about enlightening functions, so I wouldn't worry about the extra costs of making all of these extra function calls to do simple things.

One more thing to note is that there is no **free memory pointer** anywhere inside of this code, this particular application doesn't use arrays or structs anywhere, so it isn't necessary, not having the extra step to allocate the **free memory pointer** will actually create a smart contract that is more efficient.

Solidity will always allocate a **free memory pointer** and load it into **0x40** in memory regardless of whether or not it's actually used, this leads to unnecessary work and a larger smart contract, maybe a future version of the Solidity compiler will optimize this, but that isn't the case as of the time I'm recording this video.
