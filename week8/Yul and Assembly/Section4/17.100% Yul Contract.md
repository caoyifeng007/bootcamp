We are now ready to create a contract entirely in yul, in fact, that's what you are looking at right now.  

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

object "Simple" {
    code {
        datacopy(0, dataoffset("runtime"), datasize("runtime"))    // line1
        return(0, datasize("runtime"))        
    }

    object "runtime" {
        
        code {
            mstore(0x00, 2)
            return(0x00, 0x20)
        }
    }
}
```

To make things as simple as possible, I've made the contract only returned **2**, so it's going to store **2** inside of the first 32 bytes of memory and then return that aspect of memory, note that there is no function selectors or anything here, that is a Solidity thing. (一个合约分两部分，上边code部分相当于constructor，下边的object "runtime"相当于运行时代码，不管你调用这个合约的什么方法，都是返回2)

You can do whatever you want inside of yul, now let's look at the part that would be new which is the constructor portion (line1), this "**runtime**" is an indicator for a particular section of byte code, so **datacopy** is going to say, look inside of this particular segment over here, this object "**runtime**", get the size of it and copy it into memory, then return that area in memory.

These data markers (指双引号中的runtime) are what allow you to access different parts of the byte code of your smart contract (runtime相当于一个label，方便引用不同部分的byte code), we're going to learn more about that in the next video, but this is what a very **basic constructor** (指line1那部分的code代码块) looks like. 

At the top level, a yul has an object ("**Simple**前的object") and inside of it, it can have more **object**s or **code**.

Now, if we try to compile this thing, it's not going to work because when we look down here, it says it "expected a string literal but instead got object". 

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/yulcompiler.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

So what's going on there is we are using the wrong compiler, what you will have to do is open up **Advanced Configurations** and switch it to yul, yul also have an optimizer just like Solidity does, so if we compile it now, it works, because it's valid yul.

Now, if we were to deploy this, it's a little bit hard to test, because even though we're returning a value over here, remix doesn't know anything about that, so if I send it to 23, that is a valid transaction, but unfortunately remix is not smart enough to read the output. (意思是remix识别不出来yul代码中的函数啥的)

```solidity
interface ISimple {
		function itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract CallSimple {
    ISimple public target;

    constructor(ISimple _target) {
    		target = _target;
    }

    function callSimpleUint() external view returns (uint256) {
        return target.itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2();  // line1
    }
     
    function callSimpleString() external view returns (string memory)  {
    		(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(target).staticcall("");
    		require(success, "failed");
        return string(result);
    }
    
}
```

The workaround for this is to deploy a **regular interface** and just call this thing as if it were a normal contract, it's kind of like what we were doing earlier, I have another file over here called **10c_Yul_Interface.sol** and it's just going to take a **target** contract and then call it.

Now over here I have this very funny function name, **itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2**, this (line1) will encode a certain function selector and send it to other function, but it doesn't matter what that function selector is, because the yul contract we've programmed will just gnore it. (CallSimple合约调用yul合约，yul的constructor固定返回2，所以无论函数名是什么都没有任何影响)

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/simplecontract.png" style="zoom:62%;" /><img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/callsimplecontract.png" style="zoom:60%;" />

Let's see that in action, so I'm going to have to change the compiler back to Solidity, compile this (**Yul_Interface.sol**) and deploy this new contract, but I will want to take our target contract and pass it as an argument to the constructor. (copy了yul合约的地址，传入CallSimple合约的构造函数中，然后deploy)

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/callsimpleuint.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Now, if I do **callSimpleUint**, I'm going to get **2** back. 

Again, I want to stress that the yul code is ignoring this interface (指上边代码中的**ISimple**接口), it doesn't know anything about it.

```solidity
interface ISimple {
		function decafcoffee() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

I could have called this **decafcoffee** and it would still work. (将itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2改成了decafcoffee，调用callSimpleUint之后依旧返回2，所以这里是再次强调，无所谓接口中的函数名是什么，因为yul中都会忽略而一如既往地返回固定值)





```solidity
object "Simple" {
    code {
    		sstore(0, caller())       // line1
        datacopy(0, dataoffset("runtime"), datasize("runtime"))
        return(0, datasize("runtime"))        
    }

    object "runtime" {
        
        code {
            mstore(0x00, 2)
            return(0x00, 0x20)
        }
    }
}
```

Inside of our original code, if we wanted to do something like store the sender, we could do that (line1), so if we did something like **sstore** into slot 0 the **caller()**, then this is also valid yul except that I have to change the compiler back, so now I have that data in there. (指在0x00-0x20上存了msg.sender)

```solidity
/** 
    To Learn

    1. constructor
    2. yul doesn't have to respect call data
    3. how to compile yul
    4. how to interact with yul
    5. custom code in the constructor

**/
```

So let's summarize what we've learned, we've seen a constructor in an object that is entirely yul, yul doesn't have to respect the calldata, we've shown how to compile yul and a way to interact with it, and we've also shown that you can put custom code in the constructor.
