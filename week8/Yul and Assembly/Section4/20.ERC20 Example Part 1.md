https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#complete-erc20-example

At this point, hopefully the example in the yul documentation for the ERC20 is pretty understandable. 

```solidity
object "Token" {
    code {
        // Store the creator in slot zero.
        sstore(0, caller())      // line1

        // Deploy the contract
        datacopy(0, dataoffset("runtime"), datasize("runtime"))
        return(0, datasize("runtime"))
    }
}
```

Over here we have the constructor code which is storing **msg.sender** inside of slot 0 (line1), of course this would normally be something like **owner**, but you can't directly name a storage variable inside of yul, but this code actually has a workaround (指在yul中不能给storage变量命名这件事，代码中的**totalSupplyPos()**自定义函数就是用来给storage variable命名的) for that which we'll show later. 

```solidity
object "runtime" {
	code {	
		// Protection against sending Ether
        require(iszero(callvalue()))   // line1

        // Dispatcher
        switch selector()
        //* "balanceOf(address)" */
        case 0x70a08231 {
        	returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))
        }
        //* "totalSupply()" */
        case 0x18160ddd {
        	returnUint(totalSupply())
        }
        //* "transfer(address,uint256)" */
        case 0xa9059cbb {
        transfer(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
        	returnTrue()
        }
        //* "transferFrom(address,address,uint256)" */
        case 0x23b872dd {
            transferFrom(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsAddress(1), decodeAsUint(2))
            returnTrue()
        }
        //* "approve(address,uint256)" */
        case 0x095ea7b3 {
            approve(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
            returnTrue()
        }
        //* "allowance(address,address)" */
        case 0xdd62ed3e {
        	returnUint(allowance(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsAddress(1)))
        }
        //* "mint(address,uint256)" */
        case 0x40c10f19 {
            mint(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
            returnTrue()
        }
        default {
        	revert(0, 0)
        }
    }
}            
```

These are all of the functions that are required by ERC20, getting the balance of an address, getting the total supply of the collection, and transferring from **msg.sender** to another address, and transferring between addresses if you are approved to do so, getting the allowance of the approval and minting new tokens. These are the function selectors, just like we looked at earlier. 

```solidity
object "runtime" {
    code {
        // Protection against sending Ether
        require(iszero(callvalue()))   // line1

        function require(condition) {
        	if iszero(condition) { revert(0, 0) }
        }
    }
}
```

All of these are non-payable because what it will do is get the **callvalue** (line1) which is a yul function which gives you the value of **msg.value**, and checks if it's 0 and it is required to be, now **require** is not a yul word, it's a function that they defined inside of here for a convenience, so they say if the condition is 0, then revert, so basically if it's false, and if the **callvalue()** is 0, **iszero** will be true and this will not be false, therefore it won't revert. (line1就是保证不接收ether，所以之后的function都是non-payable)

```solidity
//* "totalSupply()" */
case 0x18160ddd {
	returnUint(totalSupply())
}

function returnUint(v) {
    mstore(0, v)
    return(0, 0x20)
}

function returnTrue() {
	returnUint(1)
}
```

Let's look at the easy **case** first, which is **totalSupply**, it's wrapped inside of a function called **returnUint**, and the way this code is configured is there's only one return statement in the entire code (意思是所有case最后都会调用**returnUint**，就连**returnTrue**也是调用**returnUint**), it's over here and this is a **return** statement that will return the execution control back to the calling contract, it's not a return like a **leave** inside of yul, what it (指**returnUint**) will simply do is store whatever value you pass in into the first 32 bytes and then return that.

For situations where the code wants to return a boolean true is just going to **returnTrue** which will itself **returnUint(1)**, and remember, under the hood in Solidity, a true value is simply a uint256 set to 1, so whatever **totalSupply** gives back that will get returned. 

```solidity
function totalSupply() -> supply {
	supply := sload(totalSupplyPos())    // line2
}
```

So let's see what **totalSupply** does, **totalSupply** is going to give back a variable that is the result of loading from storage, the **totalSupplyPos**, this is the workaround I talked about earlier because you cannot name storage variables, but if you wrap it inside of a function then you kind of can.

```solidity
function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }
```

Over here they have defined **totalSupplyPos** to just return the first slot inside of memory (应该是storage), so the first slot is returned, which is 1, then they **sload** it (line2), then they return it.

```solidity
//* -------- storage layout ---------- */
function ownerPos() -> p { p := 0 }
function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }
function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
	offset := add(0x1000, account)
}
function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
    offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)
    mstore(0, offset)
    mstore(0x20, spender)
    offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)
}
```

We'll be revisiting the rest of these variables later, but this is how it's able to simulate having storage variables in Solidity, and in reality, this is what Solidity is doing under the hood, so you get to see what actually is executed on the EVM. (上边这些**ownerPos**、totalSupplyPos就是模拟的再Solidity中定义state variable)

So the entire sequence for getting the **totalSupply** is to get the storage slot, **sload** from that, copy that into memory (**returnUint**中有mstore操作) and then return it.
