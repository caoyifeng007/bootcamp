https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#complete-erc20-example

At this point, hopefully the example in the yul documentation for the ERC20 is pretty understandable. 

```solidity
object "Token" {
    code {
        // Store the creator in slot zero.
        sstore(0, caller())

        // Deploy the contract
        datacopy(0, dataoffset("runtime"), datasize("runtime"))
        return(0, datasize("runtime"))
    }
}
```

Over here we have the constructor code which is storing msg.sender inside of slot0, of course this would normally be something like owner, but you can't directly name a storage variable inside of yul, but this code actually has a workaround (指在yul中不能给storage变量命名这件事) for that which we'll show later. 

```solidity
    object "runtime" {
        code {
            // Protection against sending Ether
            require(iszero(callvalue()))   // line1

            // Dispatcher
            switch selector()
            case 0x70a08231 /* "balanceOf(address)" */ {
                returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))
            }
            case 0x18160ddd /* "totalSupply()" */ {
                returnUint(totalSupply())
            }
            case 0xa9059cbb /* "transfer(address,uint256)" */ {
                transfer(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
                returnTrue()
            }
            case 0x23b872dd /* "transferFrom(address,address,uint256)" */ {
                transferFrom(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsAddress(1), decodeAsUint(2))
                returnTrue()
            }
            case 0x095ea7b3 /* "approve(address,uint256)" */ {
                approve(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
                returnTrue()
            }
            case 0xdd62ed3e /* "allowance(address,address)" */ {
                returnUint(allowance(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsAddress(1)))
            }
            case 0x40c10f19 /* "mint(address,uint256)" */ {
                mint(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
                returnTrue()
            }
            default {
                revert(0, 0)
            }
```

These are all of the functions that are required by ERC20, getting the balance of an address, getting the total supply of the collection, and transferring from msg.sender to another address, and transferring between addresses if you are approved to do so, getting the allowance of the approval and minting new tokens. These are the function selectors, just like we looked at earlier. 

```solidity
            function require(condition) {
                if iszero(condition) { revert(0, 0) }
            }
```

All of these are non-payable because what it will do is get the callvalue (line1) which is a yul function which gives you the value of msg.value, and checks if it's 0 and it is required to be. Now require is not a yul word, it's a function that they defined inside of here for a convenience, so they say if the condition is 0, then revert, so basically if it's false, and if the callvalue is 0, iszero will be true and this will not be false, therefore it won't revert. 

```solidity
            case 0x18160ddd /* "totalSupply()" */ {
                returnUint(totalSupply())
            }
            
            function returnUint(v) {
                mstore(0, v)
                return(0, 0x20)
            }
            
            function returnTrue() {
                returnUint(1)
            }
```

Let's look at the easy **case** first, which is totalSupply, it's wrapped inside of a function called returnUint, and the way this code is configured is there's only one return statement in the entire code, it's over here and this is a **return** statement that will return the execution control back to the calling contract, it's not a return like a **leave** inside of yul. What it will simply do is store whatever value you pass in into the first 32 bytes and then return that. 

For situations where the code wants to return a boolean true is just going to return true, which will itself returnUint(1), and remember, under the hood in solidity, a true value is simply a uint256 set to 1, so whatever totalSupply gives back that will get returned. 

```solidity
            function totalSupply() -> supply {
                supply := sload(totalSupplyPos())
            }
```

So let's see what totalSupply does, totalSupply is going to give back a variable that is the result of loading from storage, the totalSupplyPos, this is the workaround I talked about earlier because you cannot name storage variables, but if you wrap it inside of a function then you kind of can.

```solidity
            function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }
```

Over here they have defined totalSupplyPos to just return the first slot inside of memory (应该是storage), so the first slot is returned, which is 1, then they sload it, then they return it. 

```solidity
            /* -------- storage layout ---------- */
            function ownerPos() -> p { p := 0 }
            function totalSupplyPos() -> p { p := 1 }
            function accountToStorageOffset(account) -> offset {
                offset := add(0x1000, account)
            }
            function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
                offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)
                mstore(0, offset)
                mstore(0x20, spender)
                offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)
            }
```

We'll be revisiting the rest of these variables later, but this is how it's able to simulate having storage variables in solidity, and in reality, this is what solidity is doing under the hood, so you get to see what actually is executed on the EVM. 

So the entire sequence for getting the totalSupply is to get the storage slot, sload from that, copy that into memory and then return it.
