```solidity
object "runtime" {
    code {
        // Protection against sending Ether
        require(iszero(callvalue()))   // line1

        // Dispatcher
        switch selector()
        // "balanceOf(address)"
        case 0x70a08231 {
        	returnUint(balanceOf(decodeAsAddress(0)))
        }

        // "transfer(address,uint256)"
        case 0xa9059cbb {
        	transfer(decodeAsAddress(0), decodeAsUint(1))
        	returnTrue()
    	}
}
```

We're going to study the implementation of **balanceOf** next, but to do that, we actually need to understand what **decodeAsAddress** and **decodeAsUint** are doing, even though **balanceOf** just takes address (指balanceOf的参数类型是address) as an argument, under the hood, it's actually going to call **decodeAsUint** also.

```solidity
// 这里的offset理解为传过来的calldata中的第几个参数

function decodeAsAddress(offset) -> v {
    v := decodeAsUint(offset)  // line1
    if iszero(iszero(and(v, not(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)))) {  // line4
    	revert(0, 0)
    }
}
function decodeAsUint(offset) -> v {
    let pos := add(4, mul(offset, 0x20))
    if lt(calldatasize(), add(pos, 0x20)) {  // line2
    	revert(0, 0)
    }
    v := calldataload(pos)  // line3
}
```

So let's see what **decodeAsAddress** is doing. Here's the function definition, now this might look convoluted, but what it's (line1) doing is it's getting 32 bytes from the argument index (指参数offset) that you specify and then checking that the first 12 bytes are 0. (参数中的offset不memory中的offset，而是calldata中的offset，前4个字节是function selector，因为调用是**decodeAsAddress(0)**，所以是获得4个字节后第一个slot，也就是index是0的那个slot，这个参数就是balanceOf所需要的参数，然后再检查它不能是0地址)

Ok, let's break this down, the first thing that **decodeAsAddress** does is called **decodeAsUint**. Okay, so what is this doing? The first 4 bytes are the function selector and everything that's after that is a 32 byte multiple of an integer which are the arguments of the function, ultimately, what we're trying to do is skip over the first 4 bytes and then load that particular index of the argument, so if you have only 1 argument, then we're going to be looking at bytes 4 through 36, if we had 2 arguments, then we would be have to skip over the first 4 bytes and also skip over the first 32 bytes in front of that, in order to get you to the first index of the argument or the second argument. (decodeAsUint的参数offset就是他所说的index，根据调用时候传入的offset值去calldata中load对应的参数，offset 0就是function selector4个字节后的第一个slot，offset 1就是第二个，以此类推)

So in this case, this function was called with offset 0, so it's going to start loading byte 4 and then the 32 bytes that follow that, but if we had two arguments and we called **decodeAsUint(1)**, then we would start loading at byte 36. (loading byte 4意思是从index为4的地方开始load来获取第一个参数，从index为36的地方load获取第二个参数)

This (line2) check over here just makes sure that we have enough calldata, so if someone called **balanceOf** but didn't supply any arguments, then this would detect that, because we would see, well, 4 plus 32 is 36, and if calldata size is less than 36, then we know that there isn't enough calldata for this to be a valid function call and we'll revert.

```solidity
// 这里的offset理解为传过来的calldat中的第几个参数

function decodeAsAddress(offset) -> v {
    v := decodeAsUint(offset)  // line1
    if iszero(iszero(and(v, not(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)))) {  // line4
    	revert(0, 0)
    }
}
function decodeAsUint(offset) -> v {
    let pos := add(4, mul(offset, 0x20))
    if lt(calldatasize(), add(pos, 0x20)) {  // line2
    	revert(0, 0)
    }
    v := calldataload(pos)  // line3
}
```

Remember, an address is 32 bytes, but the first 12 bytes are 0, so if an address was supplied as the argument, then this will still load up 32 bytes (line3), so now we can go back here (line1，从**decodeAsUint**回到**decodeAsAddress**), we have our 32 bytes which are supposed to be 12 bytes of 0 followed by the address. 

Okay, now let's walk through what this (line4) is doing, what is **not** 0xffff....? This is 20 bytes (40个f，一共20个字节), when we call **not**, that's not going to turn this into all zeros, this has an implicit 12 bytes of 0 in front of it, so **not 0xffff...** with 20 bytes of ones in front of it, when it is flipped, it is going to become 12 bytes of ones, followed by 20 bytes of 0.

So that would actually look like this are 0xff 20 times is currently 12 bytes of 0 and 20 bytes of ones, this, like this, when it has less than 32 bytes in it, is just shorthand for what we have above. (意思就是说前边的0会自动省略，谁能sb到写那么多没有意义的0在前边...)

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/python2.png)

What will happen when we flip this, well, it will become 12 bytes of ones and 20 bytes of zero. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/python3.png)

Now that we have this value, what are we going to do with the address? Well, an address is going to look something, well, let's say... let's just construct a fake address over here, so it's going to be 0x plus 00 12 times, plus, let's say ab 20 times, so this is a valid address. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/and.png)

So if we were to byte wise **AND** these things together, let me put them in a text editor, so it's more clear. So when we **AND** these things together, we should get entirely zeros back all the way, because you can see that the 0 portion of the address should **AND** with the **f**s and the 0 portion of the mask should **AND** with the address. 

```solidity
if iszero(iszero(and(v, not(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)))) {  // line4
	revert(0, 0)
}
```

So we expect if everything is proper for this (指整个**and**的返回值) thing to be 0, if it's not 0.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/and2.png)

If there is some byte in here, like if we supplied an address that had a 1 over there, then that's not a valid address, and this **iszero(iszero())** is basically the identity, right? (Identity就是**等于**的意思，两个**iszero**嵌套起来用就是相当于把内层**iszero**的参数返回回来，只不过可能是出于某种目的嵌套了两层)

So if there is a non-zero bit in here (指参数**v**的前12个字节里如果有一位是1), then this **if** statement will be **true** and it will revert, if all of them are 0, then it will not revert. (line4那行代码，如果v是一个合法的地址，那么整个and返回值应该是0，进而**if**判断为false，就不会revert)

I'm not exactly sure why they did **iszero(iszero())**, because as we talked about earlier with **if**, if any of the bits are not 0, then **if** will return **true**, it doesn't have to be 0 or 1, but that's how they did it. (意思是**if 0x10 {}**也会当做true执行)

The value that is returned from this function (指**decodeAsAddress**) is the values, so all **decodeAsAddress** doing is just verifying that it really is address, that is, it's a 32 bytes value where the first 12 bytes are 0. 

This thing (指**decodeAsAddress**) is also implicitly checking if the address is the **zero address** because according to the ERC20 specification, if you ask the **balanceOf** the **zero address**, it's supposed to be invalid, and this will revert under that situation. (这个地方，如果v是0地址，那么**and**的返回值还是0，**iszero(iszero(0))**也是0，压根不会revert，而且ERC20也没说**balanceOf(0)**是不行的，说了**transfer**的参数**to**不能是0地址，但是yul中的实现是额外使用一个**revertIfZeroAddress(addr)**函数来检查是否是0地址，根本不是**decodeAsAddress**做这个检查)

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section4/and.png)

```assembly
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
ffffffffffffffffffffffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Because if we look at this, let's say that this **abab...** was all **0**, then this would return 0 back, so that's kind of a sneaky way of fulfilling the specification because it's not explicit, but it does the job. 

And now that we have our address back, then we can call a **balanceOf** to figure out what it is and then you will return the same as we described previously.
