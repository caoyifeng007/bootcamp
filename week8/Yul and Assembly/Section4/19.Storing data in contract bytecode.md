The last thing that we're going to look at is using byte code in the contract to store larger pieces of data. 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

object "Simple" {
    code {
        datacopy(0, dataoffset("runtime"), datasize("runtime"))  // line1
        return(0, datasize("runtime"))          // line2
    }

    object "runtime" {
        
        code {
            datacopy(0x00, dataoffset("Message"), datasize("Message"))
            return(0x00, datasize("Message"))
        }

        data "Message" "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt" // line3
    }
}
```

A really good use case for this is storing long strings, so imagine we have a string that we want to store: "Lorem ipsum dolor..." the usual thing, what we would do is put it inside of the smart contract and mark it with a **data** keyword, and remember this **datacopy** code from earlier? 

Well, you can pass an arbitrary value in here as long as the marker is placed inside of your code in a valid way, so this code (line1&line2) is returning the byte code of your contract, but this (line3) is storing this string inside of the actual byte code, you don't have to know where it's stored, the compiler handles that for you, you just point it to the "Message" and say, I want to copy the entirety and then you return it. 

```solidity
interface ISimple {
		function itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract CallSimple {
    ISimple public target;

    constructor(ISimple _target) {
    		target = _target;
    }

    function callSimpleUint() external view returns (uint256) {
        return target.itDoesntMatterBecauseItJustReturns2();  // line1
    }
     
    function callSimpleString() external view returns (string memory)  {
    		(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(target).staticcall("");
    		require(success, "failed");
        return string(result);
    }
    
}
```

So if we go back to our original interface, we actually don't have something for returning the string over here, but we don't really need that interface, in this case, we're just going to make a staticcall with no transaction data (指staticcall中的参数为空), it's going to get the results back and revert if the call failed, otherwise, it's going to turn those bytes into a string.

And when I call simple string, I get "Lorem ipsum dolor" back as expected.
