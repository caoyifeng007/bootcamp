Now we're going to discuss how yul handle storage variables.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StorageBasics {

    uint256 x;

    function setX(uint256 newVal) external {
        x = newVal;
    }
    
    function getX() external view returns (uint256){
        return x;
    }
}
```

So a traditional storage variable would look something like this: uin256 x and then we would have a function set x to a new value and it would say x is equal to newVAL, and this is public (这个地方应该是说错了，state variable默认是internal), we have a getter for it, but just for the sake of completeness, I'm going to do function getX and it's going to be an external view returns a uint256 and it will return **x**. OK this contract will of course behave the way that you expect it to, starts off as 0, but if I set it to 43, then I get 43 back. Okay. No surprises there. 

```solidity
function getXYul() external view returns (uint256 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := x
    }
}
```

Okay, so how do we do this in yul? Well, the keyword that we need to know about is **sload** and **sstore**. Let's see how we can read the variable. So it would be function, let's say getXYul and this will be an external view returns uint256 and we're going to have a return value over here and in assembly we will want to set this to be **x**, now if you do it this way, it's not going to work because it's going to say: "Only local variables are supported. **To access storage variables**, use the slot... the **.slot** and **.offset** suffixes".

```solidity
function getXYul() external view returns (uint256 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := x.slot
    }
}
```

So we're going to be learning very soon about **.slot** and **.offset**. Now slot is the actual memory location of where **x** is, so if we say return x.slot, this is actually not going to get the value back, it's going to say where **x** is, so let's see what happens there, so if we relaunch this, we're going to see getXYul and this is going to be 0, now this is referring to where it's stored, it's not referring to the value that's actually inside of it. So if I put 5 into **x** and then getXYul, that's still going to be 0 even though **x** is 5 in it. (获取的是x的slot并不是x的值)

```solidity
function getXYul() external view returns (uint256 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := sload(x.slot)
    }
}
```

What we actually need is to load it with **sload**. If you've taken my gas course before, you're probably quite familiar with this instruction, but over here what it's saying is **look inside of slot 0 and load the value that's inside of it**. So now if I update and redeploy this and then I getX, it's going to be 0 in both cases, but if I set it to 9 set and now it's 9 in both cases because it's loading from **x**.  (这里的both cases指的是getX和getXYul两个函数)

```solidity
uint256 x;
uint256 y = 3;
uint256 z = 4;

function getVarYul(uint256 slot) external view returns (uint256 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := sload(slot)
    }
}
```

So the slot is determined sequentially, this variable is going to have slot 1 (边说边添加y和z) and this variable is going to have slot 2, just to make things simple, I'm going to set **y** to be equal to 3 and **z** to be equal to 4, and so that we can look at the different slots, I'm going to make this to be get variable in general and make this uint256 slot so that we were not just looking at **x**, now, if we put slot in here, then I'm able to read from these different locations.

```solidity
uint256 x = 2;
uint256 y = 13;
uint256 z = 54;
```

So actually why don't, why don't we just make this 2, how about like this, more interesting. Okay, let's deploy this contract and if we were to get 0 (调用getVarYul函数), we expect this to be 2, if we get 1, we expect this to be 13, and if we get 2, we expect this to be 54. Now, if we look in some random (一个随机数) location, then it's going to be 0, it's not going to throw an error. What will happen is Ethereum is just going to look to that location and storage and see that there's nothing there and return the 0 value.

```solidity
function setVarYul(uint256 slot, uint256 value) external {
    assembly {
    	sstore(slot, newVal)
    }
}
```

Now setting the variable will work in reverse too. If we just allow ourselves to write to an arbitrary slot, which you absolutely should not do because that's very dangerous, but I'm just going to demonstrate it, uint256 value, so with **sstore**, I'm able to write to a slot and to a value. Now I can have a convenience thing here, like y.slot, z.slot and that will work, but let's just demonstrate writing it to the different slots. Whoops.

Again, if we get x (依旧是调用getVarYul函数), we're getting 2, if we get y, we're getting 13 and z, we're getting 54. If we were to set slot 0 to be 100 and then getVarYul 0, we get 100 back. And if we set z which is in a slot 2 to be 600 and we get this, we're going to get 600 back.

Now note that **these sload and sstore don't have any respect for the variables that already exist, there's nothing stopping me from going to slot 200 and writing 1234 in there**, so I can totally do this in yul and then when I look in slot 200, it's going to be 1234. So this is something you have to be very careful with, when you are writing assembly code, is that you can write to an arbitrary location, and if you were to write into a location where say the owner of the contract is stored and then someone changes that to be a different owner, well, then you have a very serious exploit there.

```solidity
uint256 x = 2;
uint256 y = 13;
uint256 z = 54;
uint256 p;

function getP() external view returns (uint256){
	return p;
}
```

In fact, to really illustrate this, I have modified the code so that there is a new variable in here called **p** and then a function getP, so this (指p) is inside of slot 0, 1, 2, **3**, over here, so if I were to run this version of the contract and I getP is 0, but if I set slot 3 to be let's say 22 (调用setVarYul函数将slot 3设为22), then **p** is going to come back as 22 because **p** is hardcoded to look inside of slot 3 or in assembly that would be p.slot which is 3.

Okay, let's summarize what we've learned. We have learned about **sload**, it gives you the value that is stored in a certain slot, we have learned about a **sstore** which allows you to store into a given slot a new value. And we have learned about the shortcut, a **(variable name).slot**, this is determined at compile time and never changes. 

```solidity
uint256 x = 2;
uint256 y = 13;
uint256 z = 54;
uint128 a = 1;
uint128 b = 1;

function getSlot() external pure returns (uint256 slot){
    assembly {
    	slot := a.slot
    }
}
```

Next, we're going to look at what happens when variables are packed. So in solidity, if you have something like this, then **a** and **b** are actually going to be inside of the **same slot**, and just to demonstrate that, function getSlot external view returns uint256 slot and then we will return a.slot, oops, you can't do that, sorry, and then we will in assembly, slot is equal to a.slot, oh it's saying this can be pure.

Remember slot is known at compile time so it's not affecting the state at all, which is why this can be pure. All right, we will deploy this and run it and getSlot, so this is slot 3, which makes sense 0, 1, 2, 3.

So it's saying this can be pure, remember **slot is known at compile time so it's not affecting the state** at all, which is why this can be **pure**. All right, we will deploy this and run it and getSlot, so this is slot 3, which makes sense 0, 1, 2, **3**.

```solidity
function getSlot() external pure returns (uint256 slot){
    assembly {
    	// 将 a.slot 改为 b.slot
    	slot := b.slot
    }
}
```

However, **b** is also in slot 3, as I will demonstrate, so I'm going to change this to **b**, recompile and deploy, and then when I get the slot, it's still 3.

```solidity
uint256 x = 2;
uint256 y = 13;
uint256 z = 54;
uint128 a = 1;
uint128 b = 1;

function getVarYul(uint256 slot) external view returns (uint256 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := sload(slot)
    }
}
```

Okay, so if they're in the same slot, how do you load the values? Well, that's actually a good question. Let's say I set **a** is equal to 1 and **b** is equal to 1 also, and I have the mechanism to get something from here, so I from... from a slot that I care about, so I will just redeploy this, and then if I were to get the variable at slot 3, then I get this very strange number back.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section1/getvaryul.png)

And why is that? Well, that's because under the hood we have a number with 1 at the end and then many, many zeros to the left, we have another 1 which is quite a large number.

```solidity
function getVarYul(uint256 slot) external view returns (bytes32 ret){
    assembly {
    	ret := sload(slot)
    }
}
```

You can get a better sense of what's going on if you do bytes 32 (把返回值类型从uint256改为bytes32了), and you can see how it is laid out in memory, so if I redeploy this and then get what I have at slot 3, you can get a better sense of what's going on if you do **bytes32**, and you can see how it is laid out in memory, so if I redeploy this and then get what I have at slot 3.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section1/getvaryul2.png)

Here you see the 1 which is corresponding to this **a** over here, and then I see the 1 over here which is corresponding to this **b**.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section1/getvaryul3.png)

I guess just to make it more clear, let's make **b** 2 and rerun that, here we have the **a** at 1 and the **b** at 2.

So if you wanted to get **a** or **b** back, how would you? Because obviously solidity is able to access **b** with no problem, It doesn't see the value **a** and vice versa, that's where bit shifting and masks comes in and you're going to see a lot of this when you do yul, so we will continue with that in the next video.
