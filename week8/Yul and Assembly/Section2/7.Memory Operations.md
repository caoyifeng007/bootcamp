We are now going to discuss memory and Solidity and the EVM in all the gory details

You need memory to do the following: return values when a external contract calls your contract, when you want to set the function arguments to make an external call to another contract, and when you want to get those values back, also when you want to revert with an error string that string gets stored in memory at first, and also when you want to log messages, you also need to use memory when you're creating smart contracts and using the keccak256 hash function. So it's quite important.

Memory is equivalent to the heap in other languages, but unlike other languages there is no garbage collector and there is no **free** command. Solidity is laid out in 32 byte sequence memories like storage, except that it's addressable by byte rather than an increments of 32. We'll look at this closely in a bit.

There are only 4 instructions related to memory that you need to understand: **mload**, **mstore**, **mstore8** and **msize**. If you are writing a program entirely in yul, then memory is easy to conceptualize, it's just an array. But if you have a mixture of solidity and yul, you have to be careful because Solidity expects memory to be used in a very specific manner.  (Solidity会在memory中预留0x00-0x7f，4个32字节的slots，而直接使用yul则没有这个规定，所以Solidity和yul混用需要注意这里)

It's important to note that although memory is relatively cheap compared to storage, the further out you access memory on that long array, the more you will be charged gas, and it actually starts to become quadratic, this is to disincentivize users from abusing the memory in the Ethereum nodes. So if you run this function, **mload** something very large, it's going to run out of gas, and you're not even writing to memory, you're just reading a value. So the stuff we explored earlier, like using a hash function to generate a 256-bit number for an address is not going to work in memory.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract Memory {
    struct Point {
        uint256 x;
        uint256 y;
    }

    event MemoryPointer(bytes32);
    event MemoryPointerMsize(bytes32, bytes32);

    function highAccess() external pure {
        assembly {
            // pop just throws away the return value
            // mload(0xffffffffffffffff)       // line1
            // x := mload(0xffffffffffffffff)  // line2
            pop(mload(0xffffffffffffffff))
        }
    }
    
}
```

Let's see **mload** using up too much gas in this demonstration. Over here, we're loading that very high value and we're just discarding the value, if we didn't put the **pop** in front of **mload** like this (line1), it's going to complain and say "Top-level expressions are not supposed to return values (this expression returns 1 value) use **pop()** or assign it to something". It's expecting you to do something like this (line2), so let's add that back since we don't care about the value.

And then when we run **highAccess**, it says the transaction ran out of gas. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/overtheblock.png)

Now if we want to see how much gas it actually used, it was over the value of the block because you can only have 30 million gas in a block, and loading something from this high in memory is going to cost over 30 million gas. (一个区块的gaslimit就是30m gas)

But other than that, **mstore**, **mload** behave the way mostly you would expect them to with an exception that I'm going to look at in the following slides, but if you want to store a value, you supply the slot that you want to store it in, and loading, you pull it back, and these happen in 32 byte increments just like storage, with **mstore** and **mload** you can only read in 32 byte increments, but with **mstore8** you can write in one byte increments, there isn't an equivalent for **mload** (指没有mload8) which makes sense because yul can only manage 32 byte numbers, so reading something less than 32 bytes wouldn't be meaningful. **msize** is the largest access memory that has either been written to or read from in that transaction.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/mstorevisual.png)

Let's see what happens when you call **mstore**. This would behave the same way you would expect it in storage, if you **mstore** into slot 0 32 bytes of **ff..ff**, then you're going to see **ff** stored inside of each of these byte slots, as you would expect.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/mstorevisual2.png)

But note that byte is the smallest unit of memory, so if you do **mstore 0x01**, that's not going to shift you forward at 32 bytes like it would inside of storage, it's only going to **shift you forward 1 byte**, so if you do **mstore(0x01, 0xff..ff)**, then the 00 slot is not written to, but it still writes 32 bytes, so now it's going to bring you up to the 0x20 which is 32 in decimal.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/mstorevisual.png)

In the previous one, 0x20 would not be written to because this is equivalent of 0 through 31. (十进制0..31，十六进制0x00..0x19)

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/mstorevisual3.png)

One more thing, in this example, we explicitly wrote out 32 bytes of **ff**, but what if we used a much smaller number like 7 over here? Decimal 7 is the same as hexadecimal 7. In that case, you are still going to implicitly be having a bunch of zeros in front of the 7, so you still write to slot 0, slot 1, slot 2, all of these bytes leading up until the 32nd byte over here, now this is marked as 0x19, but remember we start counting at 0x00, so this is like going from 0 through 31, and your 7 will be stored over here at the end.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/mstorevisual4.png)

If you had used **mstore8** instead, then only the zero width slot will be written to and that 7 will be put inside of byte number 0, the other bytes in front of it would be untouched. 

```solidity
    function mstore8() external pure {
        assembly {
            mstore8(0x00, 7)
            mstore(0x00, 7)
        }
    }
```

Let's step through what happens when we use **mstore8** and **mstore**. So I will run mstore8 over here and debug this transaction.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/remixmemory.png)

Remix has a handy thing that lets us look at the memory state, so when things just begin, these slots are empty, we will discuss in a moment why there is an 80 over here. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/remixmemory2.png)

But when we **mstore8 to slot 0**, that's going to put it in the very first byte, so let's run this forward until we hit the **mstore8** instruction, and after that instruction is executed, then we have 07 over there and the rest is 0. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section2/remixmemory3.png)

As we step this forward some more, we are ready to execute the next **mstore** instruction, but this is not **mstore8**, this is **mstore**, so it's going to write to 32 bytes, so when we execute that, all of the bytes in the first 31 bytes were 0 except the 7 was stored at the end, this caused the 7 in byte 0 to get overridden.
