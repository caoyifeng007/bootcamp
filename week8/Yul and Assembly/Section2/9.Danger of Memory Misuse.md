Probably one of the most important takeaways from this video is that if you do not respect the free memory pointer and if you write something yourself to memory without updating the free memory pointer, then you can get some serious bugs, like the one we will show here.

```solidity
function breakFreeMemoryPointer(uint256[1] memory foo)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256)
{
    assembly {
    	mstore(0x40, 0x80)
    }
    
    uint256[1] memory bar = [uint256(6)];
    return foo[0];
}
```

Over here. I have a function that is aptly called **breakFreeMemoryPointer** and it will take in an array of exactly one length, now I fixed the length so that we don't have to worry about the length portion of the array when it is stored in memory, it is going to return a uint256 which ostensibly is just going to be what we passed into memory, the first item in the array.

However, when Solidity sees this ( **uint256[1] memory foo** ) over here, what it's going to do is advance the memory pointer to accommodate for this (意思是为参数这个foo分配memory空间), so this memory pointer really should be moved forward to **0xa0**, however, we will rewind it by messing with the memory pointer to put it back to where it originally was. (这段是说，Solidity看到参数是uint256[1] memory foo，就会从0x80开始分配32个bytes空间，后续分配的bar本来应该是从0xa0开始，但是因为又手动把free memory pointer置回0x80了，所以后续会出现bug)

So when Solidity tries to allocate some more items in memory, it's going to look inside of the free memory pointer and think that it should be writing to 0x80 even though this (指foo) is what is actually written in that location, so **foo** is going to get overridden with **bar**, and then when we return **foo**, we're actually going to get **bar** back, so **bar** has **uint256(6)** inside of it.

And when we pass in something like 99, we're going to get 6 back even though we might have been expecting 99.

Also, the Solidity compiler does not try to pack data type smaller than 32 bytes. (这里是特指对memory的处理不会pack)

So in storage, if you had a bunch of **uint8** next to each other in an array, then Solidity will try to put them into the same slot or **uint16**s if it will fit, and so on. (在第6节中，存储于storage的smallArray的例子会将uint8类型的值进行pack)

```solidity
uint8[] foo = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

function unpacked() external {
	uint8[] memory bar = foo;
}
```

**But if you load something from storage into memory, then it will be unpacked**. Here is a demonstration, we know from previous videos that all of these values are going to be kept inside of one 32 byte slot because **uint8** are small enough for that, however, when we run **unpacked**, this is going to exist over the course of several 32 byte slots.

So here we run **unpacked**, we will debug the transaction, go almost to the very end and look at the memory, and see it is **1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on** and they are not packed. (每个数字都是占据32个字节)
