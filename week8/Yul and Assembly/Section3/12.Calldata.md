In this video, we're going to study calldata in all the gory details. The part that we're going to look at today is the last part of the Ethereum transaction that you can directly access from inside the smart contract. (应该是说storage、memory和calldata，这个section讲的calldata是最后一部分)

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/howgethconstructtxn.png)

This is a snippet from the Go Ethereum client (**Geth**) that constructs an Ethereum transaction, **from**, it's tx.origin or origin() in yul, **to** is the wallet or smart contract that is receiving the transaction, **amount** is msg.value or callvalue(), **gasPrices** is gasprice(), and the last one is tx.data. (这段意思是说一笔交易的组成部分都有这些)

In Solidity, you would access the transaction data as **tx.data**, but in yul, there isn't a one to one correspondence with that. (calldataload, calldatasize, calldatacopy)

Something that I really want to emphasize is that **tx.data** can be arbitrary and it's only constrained by the gas costs, the longer the transaction data array is, the more gas the sender pays. (指data长度是任意的，只不过你data越长，花费的gas越多)

The reason why I keep pointing out this array can have arbitrary length and arbitrary values in it, is because **Solidity's dominance has enforced a convention on how this array is used**, when sending to a wallet, you don't put any data in unless you are trying to send that person a message, and hackers do this to taunt people.

So for example, I have Metamask over here and if I wanted to send to an address some ether and say "you got pwned", this is a valid transaction, and when the hex data is interpreted as a string, then the message shows up. In fact, I don't even have to send any ether with this transaction, I could send no ether and just send the message, this is valid too.

But when you are dealing with Solidity, **Solidity reserves the first 4 bytes inside of this array to specify the function selector and everything after that is the abi encoded function arguments for that function**, you can learn more about ABI encoding in the [link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#contract-abi-specification) over here, but you'll get a pretty good sense of it after this video. 

(这两段意思是说，如果用一个外部账户向另一个外部账户发起一笔转账交易，压根不需要用到tx.data这部分，但是如果是向另一个合约发起交易，那么Solidity在处理tx.data的时候就会按照规定来解析，比如前4个字节是function selector的前4个字节，之后是abi.encode的参数)

Solidity expects the bytes after the function selector to always be a multiple of 32 in length, but this is a convention. Like we saw last time, with the function returning more bytes than the signature specified, you can send more bytes than the smart contract is expecting, but it will just ignore them, however, this is just how Solidity works. 

In yul, you can program your smart contract to respond to an arbitrary length **tx.data** in an arbitrary manner, or you can program it to completely ignore tx.data, it's up to you.

Function selectors in Solidity are the first 4 bytes of the **keccak256** of the function signature, so if you have something like **balanceOf(address _address)** like an ERC20 does here, then **the function signature would just be the function with the arguments as the data types and no variable names**. In this case, the first 4 bytes of the **keccak256** would be what we have here.

The **tx.data** will look like what we have below, the first 4 bytes are the function selector and then concatenated to it is the first argument because addresses have 20 bytes, but **abi encoded** data is always a multiple of 32 bytes, the address is left padded with zeros. 

```python
uint<M>: enc(X) is the big-endian encoding of X, padded on the higher-order (left) side with zero-bytes such that the length is 32 bytes.
address: as in the uint160 case
```

(这段大概是说，abi.encode返回值都是32个字节的整数倍，address是20个字节所以要补齐到32个字节，详情可以参考[文档](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#formal-specification-of-the-encoding)的这两段，如果参数是uint<M>的话，那么就是单纯地在值前边补0，补够32的倍数，address也一样，只不过address是被当成uint160)

Let's look at another case, over here we have **balanceOf** taking two arguments, one is an address and the next one is an ID, so this might be an ERC1155 token, and over here we have the function selector coming first, followed by the zero padded address, followed by the integer that comes at the end. 

Now it actually doesn't matter if the function argument was a **uint256**, **uint128** or **uint8**, **the abi encoded data for the function will always be 32 bytes**, so if you were to call **balanceOf(address, uint8)** or **balanceOf(address, uint256)**, the abi encoded data would be identical.

When you created the front-end for your smart contract, you had to tell **ethersjs** the abi specification of your smart contract, that's how it knows how to create the combination of the function selector and the abi encoded arguments that follow it.

When you are using an **interface** in Solidity, it is behind the scenes turning your function call into the concatenation of the function selector and the abi encoded arguments, the same thing happens when you use **abi.encodeWithSignature**.

However, if you want your yul code to make an external call to another Solidity smart contract, then you're going to have to implement all of this yourself, yul doesn't have a notion of function selectors interfaces or ABI encoding. However, you're going to have to follow the convention, if you want the receiving smart contract to interpret your function call correctly.
