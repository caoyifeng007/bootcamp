In this video, I'm going to explain how variable length arguments are encoded in the calldata. 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract VariableLength {

    function threeArgs(
        uint256 a,
        uint256[] calldata b,
        uint256 c
    ) external {}
}
```

This is most clearly illustrated when you have a variable length data type sandwiched between two fixed length data types.

Over here I've pre-populated the values with a 7, a [1, 2, 3] and a 9, when we run this transaction and then copy the calldata, and format it.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/calldata.png)

This is what it will look like, you'll note that the **7** is in the first word and the **9** is in the third word, that's exactly what we expect, 7 and 9.

But what's this thing in the middle? This is a pointer to the argument portion of the calldata (calldata分两部分，前4个字节是function selector，之后是参数部分) where the variable length data begins, so 60 is pointing over here (值是0x60指向了第5行0x03), because this is indexed as 0 through 1F (第2行地址是0...1f), 20 through 3F (第二行地址是20...3f) and so forth, so 60 begins in this slot (第5行) and this 3 is the length of the array, it says you need to look forward 3 more slots, 1, 2, 3. 

And so this is how this function is going to encode 7 and array of 1, 2, 3 and 9, remix is adding quotes around this because I've run this before I started recording this video, but hopefully the point is still clear (他是说remix会自动添加的双引号). (这段是说如果调用一个接收可变长度数组的函数，那么就要像上边那样构建calldata)





```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract VariableLength {

    struct Example {
        uint256 a;
        uint256 b;
        uint256 c;
    }
    
    function threeArgsStruct(
        uint256 a,
        Example calldata b,
        uint256 c
    ) external {}
}
```

It behaves a little bit differently if there is a struct.

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/threeargsstructcalldata.png)

Let's look at that, so here is a struct of 7 and 9 again, but with 1, 2, 3 supplied for **a**, **b** and **c**, so here we have the struct in the middle and the fixed length arguments surrounding it. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/calldata2.png)

When this is encoded, it's actually going to lay out the struct and not point to somewhere else because it knows in advance how big the struct is, by comparing these, you can see that if you are using tuples that you know have a fixed length, you can see that it is more efficient to use structs instead of arrays if you know in advance how long the length is, because the array version must encode a pointer to where the array is stored as well as how long it is, the smaller your calldata is, the less gas the transaction will cost, so this method is to be preferred if your tuples are a fixed length. 





```solidity
function fiveArgs(
    uint256 a,
    uint256[] calldata b,
    uint256 c,
    uint256[] calldata d,
    uint256 e
) external {}
```

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/fiveargs.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Just to illustrate the point even further, we're going to look at what happens when there are 5 arguments laid out in this manner, so here we have 5 arguments with **a**, **c** and **e** being stored as 5, 7 and 9, and for argument **b**, I have stored 2, 4 and for argument **d**, 10, 11 and 12 which will correspond to a, b and c when converted to Hex. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/calldata3.png)

Let's see what that looks like, here we have 5, 7 and 9 and the pointers to the arrays which are a0 and 100, I've already labeled them (添加了地址index) over here, a0 corresponds to this segment (line 23) over here and this (line 23的2) is the length of the array, followed by 2 and 4 which is what we add from over here, similarly, hex 100 (line 21) points to this 3 (line 26) over here which is the length of a, b and c which correspond to 10, 11 and 12. 





```solidity
function oneArg(uint256[] calldata a) external {}
```

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/onearg.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

This pattern holds even when there is only one argument, over here we are passing in 1, 2, 3 as usual. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/calldata4.png)

And the calldata for that is going to have a pointer (line 32的20) to where it is stored (line 33), the length of the array (line33) and the contents of the array (line 34 - line 36). Now this might seem a little bit wasteful because why do you need to point it anywhere when there's only one item? Whatever the reason is, this is the design and this is what solidity is expecting, note that 20 is of course corresponding to this segment (line 33) over here.





```solidity
function allVariable(
    uint256[] calldata a,
    uint256[] calldata b,
    uint256[] calldata c
) external {}
```

When all of the variables are a variable length, it should be predictable. 

<img src="https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/allvariable.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Here I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

![](https://gitee.com/elvinsj/bootcamp/raw/main/week8/Yul%20and%20Assembly/Section3/calldata5.png)

This is a pointer to **a**, a pointer for **b**, and a pointer for **c**, 60 is going to point over here to let us know that we have array 1 and 2, c0 is going to point to this 3 over here to let us know that over 3, 4 and 5, and 140 is going to point to this 4 over here to where we have 6, 7, 8 and 9, I don't need to label the indexes here, I think you get the point already.

A natural question is how does Solidity know that this is a pointer rather than a uint256? Well, it does that because it knows, in advance, the function signature and Solidity compiles some safeguards in place to make sure that there is one actually enough data to properly fill in the arguments and that the data is compliant with the format you expect, of course, when you are using yul, you have to do this manually, but the point of this exercise is so that if you are interfacing with a Solidity contract, you know the format of the data that it is expecting. (这段大概是说，一个函数编译完就知道了这个函数需要的参数的格式，然后传递进去的实参满足格式就可以运行，不满足就无法运行)
