We are now ready to look at the final missing gas costs, which is actually attributable to memory. Memory in solidity is a long array that is indexed in 32 byte increments. So remember the MSTORE instruction? If we were to say MSTORE 0xFF into the 0 slot (这个地方0xFF,0x00位置颠倒了，把0xFF存到0x00位置上应该是MSTORE 0x00 0xFF), this is what it would look like. The first 32 bytes (leftmost 31 bytes) would be 0 and the rightmost would have the hex value FF inside of it, which is all ones, and the remaining parts would be zero. You can think of this is the same kind of memory and like RAM, this only stays around as long as the transaction is being executed.

Remember how we kept seeing PUSH 80, PUSH 40, MSTORE at the beginning of the function call? What that's doing is it's looking in slot 40 and storing the value 80 over there, these are in hex values. This is actually 128 (0x80=128). That is to fulfill this [solidity specification over here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_memory.html). 

![](memorylayout2.png)

Just to give a quick visualization of memory slots. When I say something is stored in slot 0, that's means it's being stored from 0 to byte 32 (指第一个块的范围). Remember, 0x20 is 32 in decimal. So this is 0 through 32, 32 through 64 and 64 through 96 and so forth. So the Operation MSTORE 0x40 0x80 is saying store inside of slot 64. So from slot 64 to 96, store the value 0x80, which is 128.

```go
Layout in Memory

Solidity reserves four 32-byte slots, with specific byte ranges (inclusive of endpoints) being used as follows:

	0x00 - 0x3f (64 bytes): scratch space for hashing methods

	0x40 - 0x5f (32 bytes): currently allocated memory size (aka. free memory pointer)

	0x60 - 0x7f (32 bytes): zero slot
```

If you are curious where this number 128 (memory预留4个32byte的空间) is coming from, it's simply the sum of all of these bytes over here, 64 plus 32 plus 32 is 128 or 0x80 in hexadecimal, solidity will always allocate these values regardless of whether or not you actually use them, that's just how the compiler works. So the first 64 bytes are a scratch space for hashing methods, and this 32 byte slot is where that 0x80 is being stored, so it's saying we've currently allocated 128 bytes or hex 0x80. So MSTORE 0x80 0x40 is putting the 0x80 inside of this slot (指0x40-0x5F，第三个32byte). 

```go
The zero slot is used as initial value for dynamic memory arrays and should never be written to (the free memory pointer points to 0x80 initially).
```

And if we were to actually be using the memory and allocate more of it, it would begin at slot 0x80.

And you can see that in the [specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes) here, because it takes the arguments where is the starting point in memory that we're going to store the value and it goes from the starting point to the starting point plus 32 and stores the value there.

So after we execute this operation, then the number 128 in decimal or 80 in hex will be stored in the third slot of memory.

What could happen if we had done something other than PUSH 40 of storing it in the byte slot corresponding to hex 40? Well, if we had done MSTORE some value into slot 0, it would be using slot 0 through 0x20. So this is from 32 to 64, to 96. (整段话肯定是他搞颠倒了，把80说成40，图中的N的位置应该在右边)

And **every time, for every 32 byte segment that you allocate, you pay 3 gas**. 

![](yellowpaper5.png)

You can actually see that inside of the Etherium ~~White~~ Yellow Paper right here. So $G_{memory}$ for every word or these 32 bytes that you allocate in memory, then you will pay 3 gas for it. It's a little more complicated than that, but that's all you need to worry about for now. 

Even if you don't use the previous slots, you're still going to be charged 3 gas for them anyway. So if you write to slot 100, you're still charged as if you had written to the 99 slots before it, or it doesn't matter if you wrote to it or not. You're just charged.

And here you might be seeing how the pieces can start coming together. When we do this operation (PUSH 80, PUSH 40, MSTORE), we are writing from slot 40 to slot 60, and from 0 to 60 we're actually using up 3 slots and each of these 3 slots costs 3 gas and there is our missing 9 gas. So when we add all of this up, we actually get 21,138 which is the same value as the transaction. 

Okay. Where do we go from here? Well, I wanted to give you an overview of where all the different gas costs come from so that you know where to look, at least at a theoretical, foundational level. I don't want to just give you a bunch of tips and tricks and you don't know why those tips and tricks work. 

![](summary.png)

So there are 5 ways that you can save gas. 

One is by making your smart contract smaller because the less bytecode you deploy to the blockchain, then that's less storage requirements for the nodes. 

And during computation, so if you use fewer opcodes or less opcodes, then the execution of the transaction will be cheaper. And we saw how the transaction data part costs us ether 4 gas or 16 gas depending on whether our byte is zero or non-zero. So we want to write as few bytes as possible and we want most of them to be zero. 

And we'll be having a section on that where we cover tricks about how we can accomplish that. And we just looked at how memory costs gas, the more memory you allocate, the more gas you pay. And interestingly, solidity doesn't have a garbage collector or anything like that, so you cannot allocate memory. So we'll be looking at tricks to avoid spending too much gas on memory. 

And finally, storage, we didn't cover it very much here except that it briefly at an earlier example. But this is actually a substantial area for gas saving, and it's a little bit intricate. So we'll be giving an entire section to it. 

The rest of this course is going to be looking at each of these five sections, along with a few auxiliary things, so that when you approach a problem and think, okay, I want to save gas, then, you know, at a theoretical and foundational level where exactly you should be looking.
