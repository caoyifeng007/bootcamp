Ethereum transactions that revert still have to pay gas, if they run out of gas, they pay the full limit. If they revert because they hit a revert opcode such as from a require statement or because they caused an integer to overflow and there was overflow protection in place, they pay the gas up until that revert opcode was hit, but they don't pay for the gas afterwards. The implication of this is that we should revert as early as possible in the execution to save the user gas in case the transaction reverts.

contract RevertEarly {

    uint256 public x;

    function revertTest(uint256 i) external {
        require(i < 3, "i must be less than 3");
        x = i;
    }
}

contract RevertLate {

    uint256 public x;

    function revertTest(uint256 i) external {
        x = i;
        require(i < 3, "i must be less than 3");
    }
}
```

Let's look at two examples: In one, we will write to storage and then revert, in another we will revert before we write to storage.

Let's see this in action again. **These are in separate contracts because we want to keep the function names the same as we have discussed about in an earlier video.** Let's test the **RevertEarly** contract, this will revert if we supply a number that is bigger than 3, so let's do that, we revert and we see that the gas cost is 21,549.

Okay, let's test the **RevertLate**, first we will write the value 9 to storage and then we will check if **i** is less than 3. When we execute this transaction, we see that the gas is actually quite a lot higher, at 43,658, this extra 20,000 is obviously coming from the storage being written to.

Something interesting happens though, even though we wrote 9 to **x** before we reverted, 9 is not the value that will be inside of **x**, (虽然在revert之前写入了，但是还是会被revert掉) when we check **x**, we get 0. In fact, we get 0 in both cases, that's because when a revert opcode is hit, any state changes that took place whether it's a logging, a write to storage or transfer of ether, a creation of a contract or whatever, all of that gets undone. It's only if everything succeeds that the state changes succeed too.

```solidity
contract RevertLate2 {

    uint256 public x = 1;

    function multiplyOverflow(uint256 i) external view returns(uint256 result) {
        result = x << i;
        require(result >= x, "overflow");
    }
}
```

I should note that just because it's preferable to revert before a state change or any computation in general, that doesn't make it a hard-and-fast rule. Let's go back to the shifting example. We noted that when you do multiplication, there could be an overflow, trying to anticipate if the overflow is going to take place would be quite complicated. In this case, it's simpler to revert afterwards. When we do a multiplication by a positive number, we expect that the result is going to be bigger than the original value, if it were shifted by 0 it would be the same, but if it were shifted by one or more, results should be greater than **x**. But if result ends up being zero, then we would want to revert because we knew an overflow took place.

Let's see this in action. I'm going to shift the bits left by 256 which isn't possible because that would make the one fall off the left side, and we see that the transaction reverts with overflow. In this situation, we can revert after the computation took place because trying to anticipate if the computation will revert may make it actually more expensive.

This is a separate topic, but if you are interacting with an address that may or may not be a smart contract and may or may not be untrusted, you may want to put require statements after your interaction to revert in case that smart contract did something malicious, over here, it's not really an issue that the user had to pay the gas cost for the malicious activity the other contract was doing. It's more important to revert in this case than to save the user guess.
