At this point, it will be very easy for us to calculate how much it would cost to store a file on Ethereum. Maybe it's a document, picture or a piece of music.

EVM中，1个byte=8bit，1个word=256bit，所以1word=32byte

One kilobyte has 32 sets of 32 bytes in it. So here we can just do some basic math about how much the gas will cost. Each kilobyte has 32 sets of 32 bytes. **The gas to set a 32 byte storage slot from zero to non-zero is 22,100**.

因为gas price是gwei，要从gwei转为ETH，所以除以1 billion

And let's just assume that the gas price in GWEI is 50, the ETH price is 3000, and the math will come out like this. We just multiply the gas for each of these slots that we have to set by the gas price, by the ether, and then divide by 1 billion. **So one kilobyte will cost 106 dollars.**

If I was to store something like the picture of this cat I got from Wikipedia, this is 292 kilobytes or something like that. So this is 292 and it would cost me 30,000 to store this cat on the blockchain. That's quite expensive. 

So if you find yourself needing to keep a proof of record about about large files, like, let's say you have some sort of an agreement between two parties, **it's probably not a good idea to put that agreement on the Ethereum blockchain because it's going to be quite costly. What you could do is instead has put a hash of that file on the Ethereum blockchain**. 

So if there's a dispute, the party who is aggrieved will take the file published, and take the hash of it and say, Hey, look, this is something we both agreed to in the past. So whenever you're dealing with data on Ethereum, it's oftentimes better to think about how you can keep untemporal summaries of it on the blockchain rather than keeping the actual data.
