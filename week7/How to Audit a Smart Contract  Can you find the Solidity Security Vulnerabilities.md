We learn the auditing 101 of smart contracts, and understand basic tooling for doing an audit, like slither, echidna, mythx, etc. At the end of this, we will know the audit process, the basics of how to conduct one, and how to interact with auditors. This works for solidity, vyper, or even rust smart contracts! (Although, the tooling isn't the same for every language!)
