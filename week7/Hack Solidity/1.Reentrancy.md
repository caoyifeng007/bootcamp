![](whatisreentrancy.png)

So, first of all, what is a reentrancy attack, over here we have contract A and contract B, and let's say that contract A calls contract B, the very basic idea of the reentrancy is that contract B can call back into contract A while contract A is still executing.

![](holdether.png)

So how can this be exploited? Well, let's say that contract A has 10 ethers and contract B has 0 ethers, inside contract A it keeps a record of how much ether it goes to other contracts and addresses, in here contract A holds 1 ether from contract B. Now let's say that it has a function called **withdraw** where if you have some ether stored in this contract, then here I able withdraw, and the way it works is like this.

![](exploitprocess.png)

If we first check that you have enough balance and then I will send back to you all of the eather that you've stored in this contract and then after it sends the ether back to you, they will set your balance to 0.

![](alicewithdraw.png)

![](checkalice.png)

So, for example, let's say that Alice has 1 ether stored in this contract and she withdraws from this contract. It would check Alice's balance, does Alice have ether stored in this contract? Yes, she does. She has 1 ether.

![](sendbacktoalice.png)

Next, it sends that 1 eater back to Alice, so Alice gets 1 ether and the total ether stored in his contract is 10 minus 1, which is 9 ether.

![](setalicebalanceto0.png)

And finally it sets Alice's balance to 0. So that's how the withdrawal function works.

Let's now see how content B can use the reentrancy to exploit the withdraw function. Contract B is going to need two functions: the fallback function and a function named attack, and in both functions, it's going to call the withdraw function inside contract A.

![](evecallswithdraw.png)

The way reentrancy work is like this, first Eve calls attack function, this will call the withdraw function inside contract A, inside contract A since contract B is the caller, here it checks that the balance of contract B is greater than 0.

![](casendtocb.png)

And it is since here contract B has 1 ether, so it sends that 1 either back to contract B.

![](acallfallback.png)

And when it does inside contract B, it triggers the fallback function. So now, contract B has 1 ether and contact A has 9 ether.

![](bfallbackcallwithdraw.png)

Now the fallback function inside contract B calls back into the withdraw function inside contact A and then it checks the balance of contract B, is the balance of contract B greater than 0? If you look above, you can see that the balance of contract B is still 1 ether, so this check passes and it sends another ether back to contract B which triggers the fallback function.

![](acallfallback2.png)

And now contract B has 2 ethers and contract A has 8 ethers, while the balance of contract B inside contract A is still equal to 1 ether, so this means that while the balance of contract B is now updated, it can keep withdrawing ether from contract A.

And this could keep on going since the balance is updated on the last line of the **withdraw** function, but it is not reached since it keeps on looping between the fallback function and the withdraw function, and this is how contract B and keep on withdrawing ether from contract A by calling back into contract A while function inside contract A is still executing.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract EtherStore {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

Let's now see the same code using remix: here we have a contract named EtherStore and you can store your ether in it. You can store your ether by calling the deposit function, and this will update the internal balance which is kept by using the mapping balances. You can also withdraw by calling the withdraw function. It will first check that you have enough ether stored in this contract and then it will send ether to your address, and lastly it will update the balances mapping. And finally we have a helper function called getBalance which will return the total amount of ether stored in this contract.

```solidity
```

All right. So, let's now write the contract. That's going to use the reentrancy to attack this contract. We will name this contract attack. We will store the target contract to exploit in a state variable called etherStore when we deploy this contract we are passing the address of the etherStore and then we'll set our target by saying **etherStore = EtherStore(_etherStoreAddress)** etherStore equals EtherStore and then passing the address of the etherStore. We'll need two functions to do the reentrancy exploit. We're going to need a fallback function and the function to initiate the attack. And the function that's going to start the reentrancy exploit, here, I named it attack, when we call this function, we're gonna send 1 ether to etherStore, so here that's require that we have enough ether to initiate the attack and we can do that by requiring msg.value is greater than or equal to 1 ether. The first thing that we will do is deposit 1 ether into etherStore, so here we'll say: etherStore dot deposit followed by curly braces and inside the curly braces we say value semicolon 1 ether and we call a function by putting two parenthesis.

```solidity
etherStore.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
```

So the way you send ether to another contract in solidity 0.6 is like this. You need to use the curly braces and then specify the amount that you're going to be sending.

```solidity
etherStore.deposit.value(1 ether)();
```

Now. The way you would do the exact same thing in solidity 0.5 was like this, using dot value and then specifying the amount. So this is 0.5 syntax, and this is 0.6 syntax and we'll be sticking with this syntax. After we send 1 ether to the etherStore contract, we immediately withdraw the 1 ether that we just sent, and we do this by calling etherStore dot withdraw 1 ether, and when we call this function, etherStore we send back to 1 ether that we just deposited, so this would trigger the fallback function above, so inside the fallback function will withdraw again by calling etherStore dot withdraw.

Now we want this reentrancy exploit to stop at some point, so inside the fallback function, we'll say, so we'll say: if address etherStore dot balance is greater than or equal to 1 ether, then we'll call the withdraw function. So here we're saying if etherStore has more than 1 ether, then that's withdraw 1 ether from it.

Just to quickly go over how the code is going to execute. When we call a function attack, it's gonna call etherStore dot withdraw and since etherStore is going to send back 1 ether to this contract, It's gonna execute the fallback function and inside the fallback function we check that etherStore has at least 1 ether and then call withdraw again. Lastly, we'll add a helper function to check the balance stored in this contract, and this will help us see the final amount of ether taken from etherStore. That completes the code to do a reentrancy exploit on etherStore, let's deploy the contracts and see them in action.

So I deployed to contact etherStore and attack, let's say that account: one is alice account, two is bob and account three is eve and inside either store. Alice has one either and bob as also one eater. So, in total, this contract has to either store and we can check it here let's now call this function attack to take the 2-litre stored in either store, so first, we will switch over to count to account number three, which is eve and to call the attack function. We're going to need one eater, so here we'll send one eater when we call the attack function, so e execute stu attack function, and you can see here that the transaction was successful.

So we were able to steal two eaters, even though we only deposited one eater, and we can confirm that this contract now has two eaters by calling get balance, and we can check here that it has three eaters and we can also check that either store has zero eaters by calling get balance and it has zero. Let's see how the code was actually executed by using the debug feature in remix, so here I've set up some breakpoints and you can do it by clicking on the line like this, and this will allow us to pause the code at that break point. We can rerun the transaction that did the reentrant c exploit by going to the actual transaction. Once you find the transaction hit the debug button and you'll see a screen like this on the left, and then you can hit this button here to go to the next breakpoint. So it first calls the deposit function, which updates the balance and then next it cause the withdrawal function. It checks that the balance of the attack contract is greater than one meter and it is since we just deposited one meter, so the eater store contract sends one liter back to attack contract, which caused the fallback function and inside the fallback function.

We checked that ether store has more than one eater so that we could call withdraw again. So at this point we deposited one eater and with two one eater, so inside ether store, there's two eaters left.

It calls withdrawal on either store. The balance of attack has not changed since we never hit this line so over here we still have one eater, so ether store sends another ether to the attack contract. Here ether store had two eaters and it just sent one to us. So now it has one eater left and it calls the withdrawal function again. The balance toll has not changed, for the attack contract sends another eater, so that's the third time and either stores started out with two eaters. So now it has zero eater and when we hit the breakpoint, it does not call the withdrawal function again and it breaks out of the loop of the reaction see and after we with two three eaters. They finally updates the balance and that completes the code. Execution of the reaction see exploit. So how do you prevent your contract from getting attacked by reaction? See well, I'm gonna show you two techniques. The first technique is to update your state variables before you make any external calls to other contracts. So what you'll have to do here is move this code up over here you're, making changes to the state variable before you make a call to another contract, and you may ask: how does this prevent the reaction c attack? Well, it works like this. The first call to senator will trigger the fallback function. The fallback function will call back into the lift roll function and it will make a check to the balance. But since we updated the balance before we sent the eater. The balance over here will be the updated balance after the withdrawal and, if you don't have enough eater in the balance, then this line of code will fail. So that's the first way of preventing early engine c attack by updating the code before you make any external calls. The second way to prevent early entrance e attack is by using a modifier called the entrance e guard. The idea is that you lock the contract while a function is executing so that only a single function can be executed at a time.

We all need an internal state variable to lock to contract inside the modifier. No reentrant will first check that state variable loved is not locked and then we'll set dot equal to to execute the function and then only after the function finishes, execution will set locked equal to false and then lastly, we'll put the null reentrant function. Modifier to the function withdrawal, so here we all say no reentrant and how does this prevent re-entrance e attack? Well, let's say that attacker caused or withdrawal function. This we call the null reentrant function, modifier and then set locked equal to true, it will execute the function, so the code inside here will be run and let's say that the attacker is able to call back into the withdrawal function. The second time before the first one finishes execution, so no reentrant function. Modifier will be called again, but this time around locked is equal to true, and this check will fail, which will fail. The transaction and attack fails and that completes the second technique of preventing a reaction. C attack, I hope. You found this helpful and you now know how to prevent against a region c attack.
