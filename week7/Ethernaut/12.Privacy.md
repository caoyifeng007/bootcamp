Nothing in the ethereum blockchain is private. The keyword private is merely an artificial construct of the Solidity language. Web3's `getStorageAt(...)` can be used to read anything from storage. It can be tricky to read what you want though, since several optimization rules and techniques are used to compact the storage as much as possible.

It can't get much more complicated than what was exposed in this level. For more, check out this excellent article by "Darius": [How to read Ethereum contract storage](https://medium.com/aigang-network/how-to-read-ethereum-contract-storage-44252c8af925)

和Vault一样，虽然字段是private，但是可以直接使用getStorageAt获得相应slot的值，locked独自占据slot 0，ID占据整个slot 1，flattening、denomination和awkwardness占据slot 2，data应为是固定数组，所以其中3个item分别占据slot 3、slot 4、slot 5，因为unlock函数要使用data[2]的前16个bytes，所以这里取slot 5的前16个

web3.eth.getStorageAt(instance,6) 结果取前一半
