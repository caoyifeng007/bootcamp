This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

### Beyond the console

Some levels will require working outside of the browser console. That is, writing solidity code and deploying it in the network to attack the level's instance contract with another contract. This can be done in multiple ways, for example:

1. Use Remix to write the code and deploy it in the corresponding network See [Remix Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Setup a local truffle project to develop and deploy the attack contracts. See [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).
