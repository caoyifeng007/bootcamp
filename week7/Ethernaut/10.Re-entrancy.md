The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.

 Things that might help:

- Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.
- Fallback methods
- Throw/revert bubbling
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

consensys的建议

#### Don't use `transfer()` or `send()`.[¶](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#dont-use-transfer-or-send)

`.transfer()` and `.send()` forward exactly 2,300 gas to the recipient. The goal of this hardcoded gas stipend was to prevent [reentrancy vulnerabilities](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/reentrancy/), but this only makes sense under the assumption that gas costs are constant. Recently [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) was included in the Istanbul hard fork. One of the changes included in EIP 1884 is an increase to the gas cost of the `SLOAD` operation, causing a contract's fallback function to cost more than 2300 gas.

It's recommended to stop using `.transfer()` and `.send()` and instead use `.call()`.

```
// bad
contract Vulnerable {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        // This forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough if the recipient
        // is a contract and gas costs change.
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

// good
contract Fixed {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        // This forwards all available gas. Be sure to check the return value!
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");
    }
}
```

Note that `.call()` does nothing to mitigate reentrancy attacks, so other precautions must be taken. To prevent reentrancy attacks, it is recommended that you use the [checks-effects-interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html?highlight=check effects#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern).
