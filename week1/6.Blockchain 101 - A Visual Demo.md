This is a blockchain demo, we're going to do this in a very visual way though , I'm going to make it very easy to understand by stepping through the key pieces of what a blockchain is in a visual way. But before we get started we need to take a look at this thing that we call a SHA-256 hash.

OK, a hash this is one of them right here, hash looks like a bunch of random numbers, and essentially what it is it's a fingerprint of some digital data and it just so happens it's the fingerprint of whatever i type in this box, so if I type my name "anders" into this box you see that the hash has changed, matter of fact it changed every time I typed a letter, right?

So I'm go back to,(删掉了多余的，输入变为anders) so it says anders, OK, so this is the hash of the name anders all lower case it starts with 19ea, right? OK, so if i delete that and I go again type "anders" again you can see it starts with 19ea the same exact hash, in that sense it's a digital fingerprint of this data whatever data is here.

Every time you type exactly the same data you get exactly the same hash and i can type anything i want, so I can you can have nothing like this you know e3b0 that's the hash of nothing or you could type tons and tons of stuff, a matter of fact you could put like the Library of Congress in here and you would get a hash, and the interesting thing about it is regardless of there, if there's a tiny amount of information, no information or the entire library of congress you're always going to get a hash that is this long, this many characters.

You're not going to be able to pre guess what this is, you kind of have to put the library of congress in here to figure out what the hash is but you always get exactly the same hash regardless how many times you put exactly the same information in.

So what I'm gonna do is extend this idea of a hash into something that we're going to call a block. Alright so let's take a look at a block, so this is a block and it's exactly like the hash it's just that data section I've broken out now into three sections, one called block,(2:28) this is just some kind of a number this block number 1 a nonce which is just yet another number will go into what that is in a second and then just some more data just very similarly to the way that we had it before however the hash of this which includes all of this information up here is down here and it begins with four zeros you see that it's a relatively unusual hash you know most of them are not really going to start with four zeros like that but this one happens to and because it does totally arbitrarily i'm going to say that this block is signed ok so what would happen if i were to change any one piece of this information let's say if i were to type something here
